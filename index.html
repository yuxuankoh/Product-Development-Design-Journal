							<p>I started off researching about good designs and products that were useful and novel. These are some of the designs that I was inspired from.</p>
							<a><img src="images/2- gd design.png" alt="" /></a>
							<br>
							<ol><li>Fitbit: The design of the Fitbit in the wearable health tech industry impresses me as a small watch-like device can act as a sleep tracker, active tracker, pedometer yet allow users to feel comfortable. </li>
								<li>Self Stirring Mugs: Years ago, I would not have imagined my cup of hot chocolate can be evenly stirred without a spoon. Today, the design of self stirring mugs with the magnetic pill at the bottom of the cup has allowed many users to enjoy well stirred hot drinks. </li>
								<li>iPhone: Designed in a way that is clean and simple,, many people today own an iPhone designed with many functions and ease of usage in mind. This also gives about a better user experience.</li>
								<li>Dyson Purifiers: Dyson purifier incorporates new sensing technology to capture ultrafine dust and allergens while destroying potentially dangerous indoor pollutants. Its stylish lightweight design is also seen as a bonus for many homeowners.</li>
								<li>Automatic Soap Dispensers: Designed to dispense sufficient amount of soap for users, it minimizes wastage. The auto sensors also allow for a contact free experience.</li>
								<li>UV Disinfectant: Blast UV™ is a portable yet extremely powerful UV-C disinfector with the design and incorporation of 3 gold-plated sapphire LEDs and ultra-reflective lining. The device also fits small and big objects; when folded, it’s the size of a wallet.</li>
								<li>3 in 1 Baby Stroller: Baby Stroller designed for different types of occasions which give rise to different add ons and fit on at different stages of the baby.</li>
								<li>Helmet: Hard wearable durable device that helps to protect users from head injury. The helmet is interestingly designed to allow users to feel comfortable in extreme weather conditions as well.</li>

							<p>Looking around at the things around me, I identified some bugs in everyday life that we can potentially fix.</p>
							<ol><li>Lack of Light at night in national parks. This can make navigating difficult and people may trip and fall. </li>
								<li>Soap Bottles. Towards the end, it can be hard for people to squeeze soap out of soap bottles.</li>
								<li>Door Handles. Unsure of whether to push or pull for some doors. For disabled people, opening doors can be challenging</li>
								<li>Small tins of chips (potato chips) that can make reaching for the bottom of the tin difficult.</li>
								<li>Condensation on bottles storing cold drinks which can make a mess.</li>
								<li>Utensils sliding down the bowls.</li>
								<li>Lack of spaces to hang personal belongings when eating.</li>
								<li>Unsure when the tissue in the tissue box would be finished.</li>
								<li>Unable to press buttons in lifts as hands are filled with shopping bags.</li>
								<li>Too many wires hanging around from extension cords / power source.</li>
								<li>Lack of indicator when battery operated devices are running low.</li>

							<p>This problem came about from my road trips and bicycle trips in San Francisco.</p>
							<img src="/images/5- MeCycle.png" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p>I love to explore new places and travel but sometimes at night. However, I do not feel really safe due to the lack of light. In fact, it was night time when my group of friends and I were riding back to Fisherman Wharf from Golden Gate that we realized some stretches of the road did not have any lighting and one of my friends even suffered from night blindness. Furthermore, the bikes we had had no light equipped with them and it was dangerous to clutch on my already dying battery phone to shine light. Also, when walking back home or traveling to places at night especially in the dimly litted places, sometimes I may not be able to see obstacles along the way. 
							</p>
							<a><img src="images/5- StressLight.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Potentially, a device like this would be able to solve the above issues.</p>

							<h4>Market Research</h4>
							<a><img src="images/6- unsafe.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Customer Research and Needs: Problem 1- 37% of Americans do not feel safe walking at night near home. This amounts to about 100 million Americans, and this does not include your regular hikers who may see a need for StressLight.
							</p>
							<br>
							<img src="/images/6- yougov.png" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p>An additional study by YouGov reviewed that women are now much more likely to feel unsafe walking alone at night than they were in 2018. All these statistics present a large market opportunity for StressLight.
							</p>
							<h4>Personas and Pain Points</h4>
							<img src="/images/6- persona.png" height = 400, width = 300>

							<h4>Problem & Opportunity</h4>
							<!-- <a><img src="images/6- unsafe.png" alt="" /></a> -->
							<p>
								Individuals often face the issue of a lack of lighting in dimly lit areas such as nature trails when  hiking or biking, which can be dangerous for unfamiliar places. In dimly lit streets, it could serve as a motivation for criminals to strike.
							</p>
							<p>
								Injuries from slips and falls on trails have consistently been one of the top 3 hiking risks. The lack of lighting on uneven grounds or unfamiliar places especially when there is no lighting can lead to accidents. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Furthermore, studies such as Crime Lab New York have shown that there is a relationship between lighting and crime rates. In fact, well lit streets have reduced crime rates but in some areas especially rural areas, lighting is not readily available. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Therefore, we aim to address this issue to make a product that can help to increase personal safety for thousands and potentially millions of people. 
							</p>

							<h4>Idea</h4>
							<p>
								StressLight! is a convenient, simple product that allows anyone who is in distress to get the attention of others nearby.
							</p>
							<h4>Product Description</h4>
							<p>
								StressLight is for the general public by providing an easy clip-on device that aims to be your next key pouch. This product can make journeys safer, and it is low cost + energy efficient! It is also lightweight, durable and affordable
							</p>
							<h4>Primary Customer</h4> 
							<p>
								Individuals that need light in various environments, or visit dimly-lit places frequently (e.g. hikers)
							</p>

									<h2>7. Patents</h2>

							<h4>List of Patents</h4>
							<p>To research about existing solutions, I have also decided to take a look at existing patents that may be relevant and serve as an inspiration for my project. </p>
							<ol><li>US8957774B2 Concealed Personal Alarm and Method
									<br>This device contains a microphone, video camera, gps, and alarm in a concealed fashion. The whole purpose of this device is to relay information about the users safety and provide a loud user activated alarm. This device provides these functions discreetly. Since it can do many things  at once, it would be easy to trade one for another to make the device suitable for our purposes. The main benefit to this patent is its compactness and many functions.
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>US9615235B2 Wireless personal safety device
									<br>This safety device connects to a smartphone for more features. When in danger, one can activate the device through a switch or voice command. This sends your location to a previously chosen contact and starts recording footage on your phone. In addition, the unit is integrated into a portable device with protective spray, taser, strobe light, alarm, etc. We can include some of the concepts and ideas while making it our own by simply getting inspiration from certain features like the gps and voice commands. Our product is not geared towards having physically injuring features like tasers and sprays so we would only look at the other features. 
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>W02008113846A1 Flash Protection 
									<br>The functions that our products aim to achieve are similar to this product. It provides a blinding flash and a high-volume siren. As well as a built-in camera. It is more on the offensive approach to emergency situations but we may want to explore different methods/uses of our product. It’s interesting to see that there is a product that is on the offensive side yet works at a distance to avoid contact with a perpetrator or intruder. Specifically, we may seek to implement a blinding flash function as an offense while maintaining the adjustable flashlight brightness aspect of our product.
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>US9087442B2: Panic device with local alarm and distal signaling capability
									<br>Similar to the alert and notification feature on the StressLight, this patent helps the user with a panic alarm that allows the user to send alerts to a local dispatch center which can send help to your location in case of any emergency.
								</li>
								<br>
								<li>US5838237, Personal Alarm Device
									<br>This patent consists of a self-contained personal alarm device capable of signaling its location to a remote site, such as a security system. The personal alarm system includes a housing enclosing a controller, an antenna, a cellular transmitter and a cellular receiver. There is a GPS system in place. This technology is something we could possibly look into and adopt in our product, as users from our interviews have claimed that they would love to see a GPS location system in our product.

							<p>After determining the idea and concept, the next step would be to determine the concepts that are relevant.</p>
							<h4>1. SoftToy Keychain</h4> 
							<img src="/images/8a-softtoy.png" height = 200, width = 150>
							<p>The design is such that the keychain can be attached to any item, and it will be aesthetically pleasing. It also allows sufficient space to house our components, so we will have more space to toy with, increasing the ease of manufacturing. Small solar panels can be incorporated into our design as well</p>
							<br>
							<h4>2. Wristband</h4>
							<img src="/images/8b wristband.jpeg" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p>Having a device that can be carried around easily and within reach can increase safety. However one consideration that has to be kept in mind is the limited space available to house all the components.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>3. Wallet</h4>
							<img src="/images/8c wallet.jpeg" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p> The components would be housed inside of the wallet. And wallet is something that people carry around, therefore useful.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>4. Card Holder</h4>
							<img src="/images/8f cardholder.png" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p>An alternative to wallet, the design is primarily to provide the user with a compact product that can easily be used in everyday life.</p>
							<br>
							<h4>5. Flashlight Form Factor</h4>
							<img src="/images/8e flashlight.png" height = 400, width = 300>
							<p>The design was meant to provide some sort of familiarity with the form factor of a flashlight. The components would be housed inside the flashlight casing.</p>

							<br>
							<h4>Design Considerations</h4>
							<ul>
								<li>Power Efficient: A power-efficient microcontroller like ESP32 would be preferred as compared to the Raspberry or Arduino. </li>
								<li>Low cost: As we aim to sell this product at an affordable price, the materials used to build this product should be able to be easily acquired.</li>
								<li>Portability: We want a design that can be easily available and portable. It would also allow us to create a low-cost product.</li>
								<li>Ease of Manufacture</li>
								<li>Ease of Use/Handling: Easy to access in case of emergency.</li>

								<p>We decided to go ahead with the wristband idea as we felt that it was economical and easy for users to wear about. Parents can also purchase these wristband for their children easily.</p>
								<p>As seen from the idea criteria, a keychain (softtoy) may be too childish from the feedback we got from our user. Many users are not willing to switch their existing wallet to a cheaper electronic wallet, a flashlight form is not very portable and aesthetically pleasing.</p>
								<img src= "images/10 3d print.png" height = 200, width = 150>
								<p>The printed prototype shown above</p>
								<img src= "images/10 me n stress.png" height = 200, width = 150>
							</header>

							<h4>Feedback</h4>
							<p>Moving forward, our further iterations would be to make the wristband material strap adjustable such that users can wear it like a watch or more stretchable (made of rubber material) and to make our electric components smaller as well to make it less bulky!</p>
